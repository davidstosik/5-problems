# Five problems

This project contains my own solutions to the [5 programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour](https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour).

Credit goes to Santiago L. Valdarrama at [svpino.com](https://svpino.com) for formulating these problems.

Solving them took me a bit over one hour, due to problem 4's complexity.

Project also includes RSpec tests to verify solutions.
